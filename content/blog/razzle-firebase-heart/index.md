Recently, I've been playing around with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/ "Firebase"). As it has a nice free tier, is a good platform to prototype apps. It has free file hosting, functions and a database (nosql).

I'm used to using [Razzle](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle "Razzle Js") for my React projects (you get SSR and HMR for free!), so I though it could be my starting point.
